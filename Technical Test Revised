1.	A customer has reached out to us that he cannot access our platform running on 45.33.22.50. Customer's complain is as follows:
•	"Hello, It seems i cannot access http://45.33.22.50/test1"
Questions I ask:
Hello, when was the last time you logged in? 
Where you logged in when the issue presented itself?
Can you access the internet?
Assuming customer is technically oriented I will ask if he used the correct port trying to type on the browser.

Troubleshooting:

I have accessed  http://45.33.22.50/test1 using port 443 which this confirms that the customer wasn’t using the correct port to connect.
Prompted with “Completed test 1”



2.	A customer has reached out to us that he cannot access our platform running on 45.33.22.50. Customer's complain is as follows:
•	"Hello, It seems i cannot access http://45.33.22.50:444/test2. When i access it seems that nothing happens"
Troubleshooting:
I would like to clarify that not being a root user limited my troubleshooting since I couldn’t restart any service or make changes.
Applying the same logic as Q1 I tried using port 443 to access the site but was hit with an “404 Not found, nginx/1.14.0 (Ubuntu)” error. 
I would try to restart nginx just to check if that would help the issue.
Using netstat I can see that port 80 which nginx normally uses is not open or the service is not listening to that port.
user3@localhost:~$ netstat -an | grep ':80'
user3@localhost:~$ netstat -an | grep ':443'
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next, I opened nginx configuration file in editor using
nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

Server {
  listen 443  default_server;
  location /test1 {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000/test1;
  }

  root /var/www/html;
}

This confirms that that the web server has incomplete configuration, but I couldn’t make any changes. 

I also run a port scan using nmap which clearly confirms which ports are open.

Not shown: 998 filtered ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
443/tcp open  https

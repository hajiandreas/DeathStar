1.	A customer has reached out to us that he cannot access our platform running on 45.33.22.50. Customer's complain is as follows:
•	"Hello, It seems i cannot access http://45.33.22.50/test1"
Questions I ask:
Hello, when was the last time you logged in? 
Where you logged in when the issue presented itself?
Can you access the internet?
Assuming customer is technically oriented I will ask if he used the correct port trying to type on the browser.
Troubleshooting:
Ping device, If down restart it if not I log in
Check the logs
Ping outside of network to check internet connectivity 
Check the firewall for anything that might refuse access or allow IP to access said device
Check if all the needed services are running like webserver, customers services etc. if not I investigate when/why it went down through the logs and then start it
Or the service might be working but its stuck and might need restarting it

•	"Hello, It seems i cannot access http://45.33.22.50:444/test2. When i access it seems that nothing happens"

Questions I ask:

•	Hello, when was the last time you logged in? 
•	Where you logged in when the issue presented itself?
•	Can you access the internet?
•	Assuming customer is technically oriented I will ask if he used the correct port trying to type on the browser.

Troubleshooting:

•	Check the logs
•	Ping outside of network to check internet connectivity 
•	Check the firewall for anything that might refuse access or allow IP to access said device
•	Check if all the needed services are running like webserver, customers services etc. if not I investigate when/why it went down through the logs and then start it
•	Or the service might be working but its stuck and might need restarting it

The 2 questions are similar to each other therefore I would follow almost the same kind of troubleshooting just to confirm that everything is working as intended
